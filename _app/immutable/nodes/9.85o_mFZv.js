    specializing in computational biology. I am particularly interested in
    applications of artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) to design
    novel therapeutic peptides and study lysine methylation. I have also
    developed an interest in high performance computing throughout the past
    years. My thesis advisors are Profs. <a href="https://www.sce.carleton.ca/faculty/green/green.php">James R. Green</a> (Systems and Computer Engineering) and <a href="https://www.biggarlab.ca/">Kyle K. Biggar</a> (Biochemistry).</p> <h2>Current reseach</h2> <p>As part of my thesis work, I apply AI/ML tools to the study of lysine
    methylation. My research can be subdivided into three research themes:</p> <img id="thesis-themes" src="/img/1-thesis_themes.png" class="svelte-44bdo"> <ol><li class="svelte-44bdo"><b>Proteome-wide identification of the lysine methylation sites</b><br> Our cells express over 20,000 proteins, a large portion of which are substrates
      in a set of chemical reactions called post-translational modifications (phosphorylation,
      acetylation, methylation, etc.) These reactions can modulate the function,
      stability and localization within the cell. I aim to develop new machine learning
      approaches to answer questions such as: <i>What proteins are methylated? How does this relate to other
        modifications? What are the implications of this modification?</i></li> <li class="svelte-44bdo"><b>Improving the computational efficiency of in silico design of lysine
        methyltransferase inhibitors</b><br>I am improving upon the state-of-the-art algorithms for peptide
      inhibitor design using sequence information only, as existing algorithms
      are computationally intensive and not scalable. We are developing a fast
      algorithm named Darwin which leverages large databases of protein-protein
      interactions active peptides capable of specifically modulating the
      activity of lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) and lysine demethylases
      (KDMs). Overactive KMTs/KDMs are involved in a number of cancers, and
      these peptides could supplement existing therapies and improve their
      efficacy.</li> <li class="svelte-44bdo"><b>Optimizing the design process for difficult-to-target proteins</b><br> Sequence-based peptide engineering methods rely on validated protein-protein
      interactions (PPIs). In some cases, databases of known PPIs provide insightful
      information that can guide the peptide design process. In other cases, the
      finite set of known interactions is insufficient as the target may bear little
      similarity to proteins with known interactors. I am trying to improve the search
      strategy in a very large peptide space in order to probe it more efficiently
      using deep learning techniques (protein language models).</li></ol> <h2>Previous research</h2> <ol><li class="svelte-44bdo"><b>Structural biology</b><br> Under the supervision of <a href="https://med.uottawa.ca/bmi/en/people/couture-jean-francois">Prof. Jean-Fran√ßois Couture</a>, I completed my my <a href="https://charih.ca/Charih_Honours_2015.pdf">honours thesis</a> on the structural characterisation of the Fur (Ferric Uptake Regulator) protein
      in Campylobacter jejuni a pathogenic agent responsible for numerous cases of
      gastroenteritis. I crystallized the protein and built a draft model of the
      structure, which was further refined by Prof. Couture. This research was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-25157-6">published</a> in the scientific journal <i>Scientific Reports</i>.</li> <li class="svelte-44bdo"><b>Computational audiology</b><br> I have previously worked in computational audiology. My <a href="https://curve.carleton.ca/873548bb-f077-49d4-a5a6-9a69fddf1284">master's thesis</a> work focused on the ML-assisted classification of audiograms to facilitate
      their interpretation by non-experts.</li></ol>`,1);function m(e){r(e,{children:(t,l)=>{var i=n();o(14),a(t,i)},$$slots:{default:!0}})}export{m as component};
