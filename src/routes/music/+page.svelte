<h1>Music</h1>
<p>
  In my spare times, I enjoy playing the guitar and singing. I started
  songwriting in my late teens.
</p>
<p>
  Life (grad school) got in the way and left me with very little time to play
  and write music. Art and music are important, but fighting diseases is
  important too! I'm starting to get back into it as I'm wrapping up that PhD
  and am writing new songs.
</p>
<p>
  You can listen to my latest single <i>Half Moon Eyes</i> in the meantime.
